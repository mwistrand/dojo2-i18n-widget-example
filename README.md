# A Dojo 2 i18n example app

This small application is intended as an example for how i18n might be incorporated into [`dojo-widgets`](https://github.com/dojo/widgets).

It displays two globalized widgets and two selects with locale options. The first select controls the root locale, while the second controls the second widget directly.

## Running

Execute the following commands from the repo's root directory, start an HTTP server, and then visit http://localhost/.../build/src/.
```
$ npm install
$ grunt dev
```
